				<p>I co-founded the LLC on March 18th 2014 with my friend Abhi Upadhyay. We created it to publish our mobile games we created using Corona SDK. We taught summer classes in 2015-2016 for mobile game development and Java.</p>

					<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>

				<p>We published 7 apps to the store (2014-2017), including apps compiling the student projects during our summer classes. We used Corona SDK (now Solar2D) and coded in Lua. We also published a VR Cardboard app in 2017, Block Dash VR which is still available on the play store.</p>

					<h3>Coding Classes</h3>
				</header>
				<p>We taught students coding during the summers of 2015 and 2016. We held mobile game development classes using Corona SDK and focused on iOS development. At the end of each class we would compile the student made games and publish them onto the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. We also held Java classes in 2016.</p>
