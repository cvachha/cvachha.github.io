## Overview
For my masters thesis, I am trying to create a system based on the proposal I made in 2022 [here](nerfenvironmentcreation.html).
We propose Dreamcrafter, a Virtual Reality 3D content generation and editing system Assisted by generative AI. Our system addresses this gap by proposing a system that harnesses the immersive experience and spatial interactions of VR, coupled with the advanced capabilities of generative AI, to enhance the process of 3D environment creation and editing. 

NeRF and diffusion models offer unparalleled realism and detail in rendering, however, their integration into user-friendly platforms for 3D environment creation is still in its infancy.
Dreamcrafter aims to bridge these gaps by creating a seamless and intuitive interface for users to design, modify, and generate complex and photorealistic 3D environments. Editing of radiance fields and generative 3D objects is currently limited to text prompts or limited 2D interfaces. Current research in NeRFs and diffusion models is primarily on enhancing image/reconstruction quality, and we aim to address the noticeable lack of exploration in the application of user interfaces designed for editing and controllability of these models and novel 3D representations. 
The core of our approach is a VR-based system that allows users to interact with and manipulate 3D objects and environments in real-time. Dreamcrafter involves two subsystems systems which leverage novel 3D representations and stable diffusion. The stable diffusion powered system assigns semantically mapped spatial tags to 3D primitive objects to generate stable diffusion previews of scenes. Our second subsystem leverages NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting for rendering and editing of 3D photo realistic scenes. Dreamcrafter is designed to be simple to use, lowering the barrier to entry for users without extensive experience in 3D modeling, while still providing realistic output results. 


Our current system is 

We developed a few prototype systems within a month 
## Prototype Demos
Here are some demo videos of our prototype systems that demonstrate a basic version of some of the key features/interactions.

## Future plans
